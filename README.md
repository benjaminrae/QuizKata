# ISDI Coders Kata - Level 0

- [Demo](DEMO.md)
- [Kata](KATA.md)

We are going to use [Gather](https://gather.town) to manage remote communication and [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.com) to write code during the kata.

The idea is that participants will be able to learn some JavaScript basics and apply them in the same session. This should be a fun and relaxing experience for the participants with the objective of strengthening their interest in learning programming.

## Introduction

Introduce ourselves and ISDI Coders. Talk about where we have come from and what lead us to the bootcamp.

Then there should be a quick round of introductions from the participants.

During the introduction one teacher should create groups of students for the kata.

## Demo

The demo should introduce the following topics:

- if
- prompt
- alert
- console.log
- const/let
- string concatenation

## Kata

During the kata, teachers should pass from breakout room to breakout room, answering questions and helping participants.
